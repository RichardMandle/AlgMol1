# AlgMol1
sandbox repo for the Python code from the paper "Automated Continuous Flow Synthesis and Purification of Algorithmically Designed Ferroelectric Nematogens"

Python functions for:

*	Generating molecules via SELFIES and group-SELFIES. 
*	Interfacing with external software for QM calculations (Gaussian, MOPAC)
*	Genetic algorithms for new molecule generation from an initial starting structure.
*	Functions for filtering algorithm output by score, by sub-structure, or specific features (e.g. ring size, no. rotatable bonds etc.)
